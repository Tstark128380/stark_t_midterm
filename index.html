        <h2>Cat Argument</h2>
        <p>In order to see why cats are superior to dogs in everyway, one must only look at their form</p>
        <img src="img/catt.jpeg" alt="The superior form">
        <p>See the disinterested gaze, the tasteful black and white coat, the graceful silhouette created by the ears.<br>But if the perfect form is not enough to convince you just ask yourself "How often does a cat ever wanted to go for a walk?"<br>The answer is unknown because cats don't beg their owners for walks, they take themselves on walks.</p>
        <p>thus the cat is easily a better pet than a dog.</p>

        <h2>Dog Argument</h2>
        <p>It is easy to see that dogs are better to cats, one must only look to its loyalty</p>
        <img src="img/dog.jpeg" alt="A friend">
        <p>A cat holds no love for its owner, for they are merely a parasite only interested in how they benefit from the relationship.<br>Dogs on the otherhand feel nothing but love for their owner.<br>because of this, you can expect a dog to alwayshave your back when all you can expect a cat to do is beg for food.</p>
