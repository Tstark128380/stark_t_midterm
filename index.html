        <img src="img/cat.jpeg" alt="The superior form">
        <p>See the disinterested gaze, the tasteful black and white coat, the graceful silhouette created by the ears.<br>But if the perfect form is not enough to convince you just ask yourself "How often does a cat ever wanted to go for a walk?"<br>The answer is unknown because cats don't beg their owners for walks, they take themselves on walks.</p>
